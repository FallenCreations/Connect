Connect brings the power of Texting and other social applications to Minecraft. It has an API that can connect to Twitter, Facebook, Google, etc. As long as the social application has an API that can send/receive Connect can use it.

Upon install we only support [Twilio](http://twilio.com) for use with texting and planning to support twitter next. Twilio is used for texting to and from your server to any phone number that is a verified phone number.
